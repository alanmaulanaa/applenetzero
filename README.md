# Apple Net Zero Dashboard

In this project, my goal is to predict when Apple's goals will be realized, with available data from 2015 to 2022. The main need in business is to see if there is any impact between Apple's progress so far on the environment and how to overcome it.  
By using Excel tools to see the structure of each dataset and exploratory analysis techniques, here I only show the 5 main findings that I visualized on the Tableau dashboard. Those findings are :  
- Emission Forecast
- Year-over-Year Emission Growth
- Emission Change by Industry
- Carbon Footprint by Product
- Revenue and Market Capitalization Growth
